# Lesson Objectives

*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Use A to...
- Use B to...
- Explain X
- Describe Y
- NOTE: The italics description of this section will stay with the lesson.  The following ones, however, should be removed (i.e. remove the descriptions for the TL;DR, Overview, Demo, and Challenge)

# TL;DR

*This should be bullet points that quickly go through the lesson content. This should make it easier for students to just get the gist and move on if they already felt comfortable with that lesson instead of going through the whole thing. PLEASE REMOVE THIS DESCRIPTION BEFORE PUBLISHING LESSON*

- **KeyTerm1** description
- Description of **keyTerm2**
- **KeyTerm3** description

# Overview

*This is the primary explanatory text of the lesson. It should be explanation and examples of the topic that students read through but aren't coding alongside with. PLEASE REMOVE THIS DESCRIPTION BEFORE PUBLISHING LESSON*

## Overview Section H2

Use title-case for H2 titles.

### Overview Section H3

Use sentence-case for H3 titles.

# Demo

*The demo portion of the lesson is meant to be tutorial-style where the reader is coding along with it. The project here should take the content from the overview and apply it so it has context and isn't just standalone code snippets. PLEASE REMOVE THIS DESCRIPTION BEFORE PUBLISHING LESSON*

### Demo Section H3 (only)

Use sentence-case for H3 titles.

# Challenge

*Short, numbered instructions for readers to do a project similar to the demo, only this time independently. Gives them a chance to know for sure that they feel solid about the lesson. We can provide starter and solution code but the expectation is the solution code is for reference and comparison after theyâ€™ve done the challenge independently.
